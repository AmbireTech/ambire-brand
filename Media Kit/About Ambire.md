# Who are we?



**The Ambire Company**

Ambire is a web3 product company. Founded in 2017, it developed the first decentralized ad network AdEx Network, the largest payments channels network on Ethereum.  In 2021 the company launched Ambire Wallet, a self-custody open-source smart contract wallet, currently hosting more than 80,000 registered users.

Our flagship product, Ambire Wallet, is the self-custody account abstraction wallet focused on security and crypto UX. With an interface that is easy to use and familiar, it makes navigating the world of Web3 a smooth and pleasant experience.

[AdEx Network](https://www.adex.network/) is the first open-source decentralized advertising platform that focuses on transparency and user privacy. It reduces ad fraud, and offers real-time blockchain verified reporting and micropayments per impression.




**Ambire Wallet**

Ambire Wallet is an open-source self-custodial smart wallet that utilizes account abstraction, acting as a gateway to Web3 applications and providing users with secure and effortless management of their digital assets.
* It’s an EVM wallet, focusing on the broader Ethereum ecosystem, available on popular L1s like Ethereum, Fantom and Avalanche, as well as L2s like Arbtitrum, Polygon and Optimism. 
* It is available on the web and it has mobile apps for Android and iOS for granular experience. A browser extension launch is planned for September 2023.
* You can register and retrieve an account using email and password only. It can be used with a hardware wallet or 2FA as well for added layers of security
* On Ambire Wallet you can pay for network fees in ERC-20 and stablecoins and you can prepay network fees.
* It has transaction simulation so that you know how a transaction will change your balances before you even sign it
* On Ambire Wallet you can “batch” or combine transactions, meaning you can bundle several transactions and broadcast them together. This saves time and money to the user. For example you can swap tokens on Uniswap without having to authorise Uniswap to spend your tokens first ( the Authorize transaction is broadcasted together with the Swap)
