**Ambire Wallet**

Ambire Wallet is an open-source self-custodial smart wallet that utilizes account abstraction, acting as a gateway to Web3 applications and providing users with secure and effortless management of their digital assets.
* It’s an EVM wallet, focusing on the broader Ethereum ecosystem, available on Ethereum and L2s like Base, Optimism, Arbtitrum and more.
* Furthermore, you can add any EVM network on Ambire and use smart accounts with the same address.
* Ambire is the first hybrid Account abstraction wallet to support Basic (EOA) and Smart accounts, improving security and user experience.
* You can use the Ambire browser extension with your existing EOA like Metamask, and upgrade to a Smart Account to unlock transaction batching, paying gas in any token, on-chain simulations, and more.
* Ambire is available as a browser extension and it has mobile apps for Android and iOS for granular experience. 
* Ambire can be used with a hardware wallet or 2FA as well for added layers of security.
* On Ambire Wallet you can pay and prepay gas with stablecoins and custom tokens. Save on gas fees by topping up on one network and paying on any supported one.
* It has transaction simulation so that you know how a transaction will change your balances before you even sign it
* On Ambire Wallet you can “batch” or combine transactions, meaning you can bundle several transactions and broadcast them together. This saves time and money to the user. For example you can swap tokens on Uniswap without having to authorise Uniswap to spend your tokens first ( the Authorize transaction is broadcasted together with the Swap)
