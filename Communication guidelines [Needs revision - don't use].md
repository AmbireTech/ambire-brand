## **The Ambire Brand**

Ambire was previously known as AdEx Network. The team behind the project started out developing the Ambire AdEx decentralized ad network, and later on pivoted to a self-custodial Account abstraction crypto wallet.

*“Ambire” is an Italian verb that means “to aspire, aim, strive” and it fully reflects the company’s  ongoing aspiration for excellence and perfection.*

*The correct pronunciation is /**’æmbaɪə**/ (UK) or /’**æmbaɪər**/ (US) - like you would pronounce “empire” for example.*

## **Key Message**

*Ambire is the Web3 wallet that makes self-custody easy and secure. It is the first hybrid Account abstraction wallet to support Basic (EOA) and Smart accounts, improving security and user experience.
